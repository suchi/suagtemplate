# signature problems (unsigned/broken signature or an unexpected committer
# email — these typically show as Unverified on GitHub; only checked when
# commit signing is configured), and unpushed commits. Exit code 2 feeds
# the message back to the agent.

# Registration: merge claude-user-settings-snippet.json (in this folder)
